# Farm-grow-fertilizer-recommender
The overuse and inappropriate application of fertilizers in agriculture are leading to severe soil
degradation and reduced productivity, directly impacting farmers' livelihoods and crop yields. This
project proposes a data-driven application designed to offer optimal, sustainable fertilizer
recommendations based on soil characteristics, crop type, and local weather patterns. By analyzing
soil health, meteorological data, and crop-specific needs, the application will provide precise guidance
on the ideal type and quantity of fertilizer required, enabling farmers to avoid excessive usage.
Using machine learning algorithms and data analytics, the solution personalizes recommendations,
ensuring nutrients are supplied in line with environmental and crop demands. This approach will
promote soil health, enhance crop yields, and increase farmers' income through sustainable practices.
The software aligns with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfareâ€™s initiatives for eco-friendly
agriculture and rural development, benefiting farmers and supporting national priorities for food
security and environmental conservation.
